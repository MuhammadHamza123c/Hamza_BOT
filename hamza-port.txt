Name: Muhammad Hamza

Academic Background:
- Currently pursuing a BS in Data Science from a small university in Multan.
- Plans to pursue a Master's degree from MIT.

Learning and Skills Interests:
- Actively learning data science with deep focus.
- Interested in learning a few machine learning algorithms thoroughly, one per week.
- Learning inferential statistics including: hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, p-values, Z-test, T-test, type I and type II errors.
- Working with descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis.
- Practices calculations manually and prefers integer-based datasets for hands-on learning.
- Interested in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
- Focused on Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Hierarchical Clustering.
- Is currently learning CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) in a 30-day schedule with 2 hours daily.
- Learning Gaussian Naive Bayes and solving datasets manually.
- Practicing model evaluation techniques including: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC, Cross-validation, Confusion Matrix.

Project and Tool Experience:
- Has used Arduino with IR sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and relay modules.
- Familiar with Arduino Cloud, ESP8266, and Blynk for IoT projects.
- Using Tinkercad to create a digital haveli (traditional mansion).
- Interested in creating chatbots using LLMs like Mistral with Streamlit and Ollama.
- Has run LLMs locally using Ollama and experimented with LangChain for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) projects.
- Wants to deploy LLM-based chatbots to websites and keep them updated using web scraping techniques.
- Also learning Seaborn and Matplotlib for Fiverr-related data visualization services.

Languages and Tools:
- Learning C programming using GCC with MinGW on Windows.
- Practicing with project files stored in directories like 'D:\c prog' and 'D:\c\mingw-w64-v11.0.0'.
- Also learning Flask and Tkinter for data science and GUI development.
- Has interest in Java and C++ as secondary languages.
- Using tools like Wikipedia Python library, Chroma, and LangChain for LLM applications.

Hardware and System:
- Laptop specs: 8 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD, and a 256 GB HDD.
- Using Windows OS, relocated Ollama data to D: drive using symbolic links due to low C: drive space.

Other Preferences and Activities:
- Enjoys solving practice tasks manually.
- Prefers to start with simple datasets and progress to complex ones gradually.
- Working on building a strong Fiverr profile with skills in data visualization and chatbot development.
- Curious about cutting-edge tools and AI trends like Grok and Perplexity.
- Often seeks detailed schedules and step-by-step learning plans.
- Asks questions strategically to guide self-learning and apply practically.
